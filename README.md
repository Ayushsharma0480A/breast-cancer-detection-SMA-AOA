# Breast Cancer Detection using Hybrid SMA + AOA Optimization

This project detects breast cancer from mammogram images using:
- Image preprocessing (ROI extraction, segmentation)
- Feature extraction (GLCM, texture, HOG, statistical)
- Hybrid SMA + AOA feature selection
- Machine learning (SVM, ANN, ANFIS)
- Deep learning (CNN comparison)
